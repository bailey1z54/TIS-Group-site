    <h1>Technology Choices</h1>
    <p>There are several strategies which can be of help in the adoption of EMRs in health care facilities 
<br><br>
      Choice of EMR System 
      <br><br>
      Select the most suitable EMR system from among the available vendors through the consideration of the relevant key attributes such as the must-have essentials, the different interfaces, the scalability options, ease of use and the compatibility options. 
      <br><br>
      Deployment Model 
      <br><br>
      Select the option between the on-premises setup where you install resin on your physical machine/ server and cloud with many platforms to choose from. While on-premises offer decisions and tunability than cloud solutions, they may require a significant amount of capital. On the other hand, the SaaS models are elastic or cheaper relative to on-premises but relies solely on the internet connection while security is a concern. 
      <br><br>
      Interoperability Standards 
      <br><br>
      In this case, select the systems that are compatible with the various system standards like HL7, FHIR, and DICOM in order to be in harmony with different providers and systems. 
      <br><br>
      (Health Level Seven International (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)) 
      <br><br>
      (DICOM is primarily used for handling, storing, and transmitting medical images) 
      <br><br>
      Customization and Flexibility 
      <br><br>
      If it's possible to make the changes according to the facts and conditions that seems to exist in the particular work context and observation regarding the system’s interfaces and the capacities of the reports it produces. 
      <br><br>
      Training and Support 
      <br><br>
      Decide whether the training of the staff will be to be done LIVE or in segments and arrange for vendor support for the ensuing running of the program. 
      <br><br>
      Data Migration Strategy 
      <br><br>
      The following are the procedures that need to be followed to transition the existing patents’ data into the new system to ensure that the quality of the patient’s data is not damaged, and that patients’ care is not interrupted. 
      <br><br>
      Compliance and Security Measures 
      <br><br>
      Select EMR systems that adhere to certain laws like the HIPAA laws and also check that the EMR systems supporting data security features like encryption and user privileges. 
      <br><br>
      Cost Considerations 
      <br><br>
      One must therefore discuss on the cost criterion which is the cost of the software and the cost of the hardware, the cost of training the users of the software to enable them optimize on its use and the cost of the support to be provided to the users as enhanced efficiency and quality patient care delivery was to be enhanced by the software. 
      <br><br>
      Hence, when choosing options to pursue in these areas of concern, there should be more stringent decision-making in the process towards the adoption of efficient EMR that will enhance the health care systems. </p>
