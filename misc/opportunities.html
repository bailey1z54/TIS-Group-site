        <p>Chances with EMR Implementation in Healthcare 
            <br><br>
            There is a great potential to improve the quality and management of care that arises from the use of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in healthcare. With the help of EMRs, doctors can quickly find out everything about a patient with no need for extensive research or time wastage. This has a positive effect towards the accessibility to better coordination between the various health care practitioners. 
            <br><br>
            EMRs also promote the improvement of clinical and population research as it compiles data to discover patterns and monitor disease progression and likely cures. This use of data is helpful as it promotes medical developments and benefits the general populace. 
            <br><br>
            Other advantages include reduction of costs and increase of the speed of process implementation. EMRs eliminate paper records in a medical facility and decrease medical mistakes thereby reducing cost and increasing efficiency. Because of this efficiency, patient satisfaction is enhanced due to decreased delays and correct treatment being provided. 
            <br><br>
            Further, adopting EMRs to telemedicine and mobile health application mean extends healthcare delivery, especially in those areas lacking adequate facilities. These cooperation improvements increase patients’ involvement and health-related actions. 
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, EMRs advance patient care and research, cut costs, and extend availability – now the cornerstone of today’s healthcare organizations. </p>
