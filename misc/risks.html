    <p>Difficulties Which May Be Encountered by a Healthcare Organization while Adopting EMR 
<br><br>
      To adopt Electronic Medical Records System has its advantages but on the other hand, it has following disadvantages which are needed to be controlled properly. Key risks include: 
      <br><br>
      Data Breaches and Cyberattacks: EMRs contain fields with patient identifiers and other patient data in their non-EMR records; due to this, a breach puts patient data at risk of being accessed or lost by unauthorized persons, among other risks. 
      <br><br>
      Data Accuracy and Integrity: Some of the sources of inaccuracy in electronic data entry include mistakes made by people and or the software; that in essence leads to the wrong feeding of patient information which defines the treatment of the patient and further culminates into some legal concerns. 
      <br><br>
      Coordination Issues: HealthCare professionals working in different types of healthcare organizations use various EMR system and as a result the level of integration in the sharing of information of the patient reduces and the challenges that a patient is likely to encounter in receiving personalized care also increases. 
      <br><br>
      Cost and Disruption: The cost implication of moving from paper-based record system to electronic record system can be very considerate as it involves procurement of equipment and software and training of staff in addition to implementation of certain techniques that might slow down workers for a while. 
      <br><br>
      Resistance to Change: Due to these characteristics, some of the stakeholders most of the healthcare providers, employees, and staff may prefer to use traditional technique or remain sceptic of the benefits that are likely to be obtained from implementation of EMRs, which adds up to the slowness of implementation. 
      <br><br>
      Regulatory Compliance: Talking about obligatory precautions for EMRs in the USA such measures as HIPAA, it is vital to highlight that enforcing rules is quite a delicate and lengthy process; non-compliance with these rules comes with severe legal penalties and business reputation deterioration in addition. 
      <br><br>
      Reducing these risks through honouring planning, training and technology measures is important to perform goals and objectives of adopting EMR systems.    </p>
